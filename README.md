# Geometrical Layout of Big Data API

Welcome to the Geometrical Layout of Big Data API! This API provides a set of endpoints to help users calculate the optimal arrangement of non-overlapping circles within a given canvas. By specifying the radius, length, and width, users can determine the number of circles that can be arranged in a triangular packaging, minimizing wastage of space. The API also provides the exact center coordinates for each circle, with the first circle being at the origin. These coordinates can be converted into geocoordinates for location-based data. With this API, you can efficiently organize and maximize the use of available space for your data visualization needs.

## Features

The Geometrical Layout of Big Data API offers the following key features:

- **Number of Circles Calculation**: Calculate the maximum number of non-overlapping circles that can be placed within a given canvas using triangular packaging.
- **Optimal Space Utilization**: Determine the arrangement of circles that minimizes wastage of space, ensuring efficient use of the available canvas.
- **Exact Center Coordinates**: Obtain the exact center coordinates for each circle, with the first circle positioned at the origin.
- **Geocoordinates Conversion**: Convert the center coordinates into geocoordinates for location-based data analysis and visualization.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Geometrical Layout of Big Data API, follow these steps:

1. Sign up for an API key at through our website or by getting in toch with our support team to access the API endpoints.

2. Review the [API Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/24860974/2s93mAUzny) to understand the available endpoints, request parameters, and response formats.

3. Make API requests to calculate the optimal arrangement of circles within a given canvas by providing the radius, length, and width parameters and authenticating with your API key.

4. Analyze the returned results, including the number of circles and their exact center coordinates, to determine the maximum number of circles that can be arranged using triangular packaging. These coordinates can be converted into geocoordinates for location-based data analysis and visualization.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how you can use the Geometrical Layout of Big Data API:

- Calculate the maximum number of circles that can be arranged within a rectangular canvas for a given radius, length, and width. Obtain the exact center coordinates and convert them into geocoordinates for location-based data analysis.
- Determine the optimal arrangement of circles to minimize the wastage of space within a square canvas. Use the exact center coordinates to perform geospatial analysis on the data represented by each circle.
- Visualize the layout of circles for efficient data representation and analysis within a custom-shaped canvas. Convert the center coordinates into geocoordinates to overlay the circles on a map for location-based insights.
